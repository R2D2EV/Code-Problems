# You are given a string of n characters, with n varying from 1 to 1000, inclusive. Your task is to write a Python function that takes this string as input, applies the following operations, and finally returns the resulting string.

# Split the given string into individual words, using a space as the separator.
# Convert each word into a list of its constituent characters, and shift each list once to the right (with the last element moving to the first position).
def sol(string):
    # Paso 1: Separar las palabras
    words = string.split(" ")

    # Paso 2: Rotar cada palabra una posiciÃ³n a la derecha
    rotated_words = []
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1:
            rotated = word[-1] + word[:-1]
        else:
            rotated = word  # Si la palabra tiene 1 letra, no se rota
        rotated_words.append(rotated)

    # Paso 3: Unir las palabras rotadas en una sola cadena
    result = " ".join(rotated_words)
    return result

# Ejemplo de uso
string = "abc 123 def"
result = sol(string)
print(result)  # Salida esperada: "cab 312 fde"


# After the rotations, reassemble each word from its list of characters.
# Join all the words into a single string, separating adjacent words with a single space.
# Return this final string as the function's output.
# The constraints for the problem are as follows:

# The input string will neither start nor end with a space, nor will it have multiple consecutive spaces.
# Each word will contain only alphabets and digits, and its length will range from 1 to 10.
# The words are case-sensitive; for example, 'word' and 'Word' are considered distinct.
# Your program should output a single string with the words rotated by their lengths while preserving their original order.

# As an illustration, consider the input string "abc 123 def". Applying the stated operations results in the output "cab 312 fde".
